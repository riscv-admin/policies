|1.1 |2022-05-10 |Add text regarding stand-in or substitute attendees to the CCM. |Stephano Cetola

|1.0 |2021-10-06 |Initial commit. |Mark Himelstein

|===

=== Rationale

Numerous members have asked to present or attend the CCM who are not
committee chairs or Premier members or Premier TSC members. In order to
be fair about who gets to visit, when they get to visit, what part of
the meeting they can attend, and the process for such requests, we
developed this policy.

=== Policy

. Guests may request to present to the CCM by approaching a member of
the CCM and asking them to sponsor the presentation. Guests who donâ€™t
know who to use as a sponsor, may use the CTO as a sponsor. +
. The sponsor should review the presentation. If the sponsor agrees to
having the CCM see the presentation, then they forward the request with
slides to the CCM email list for review. +
. During the review period CCM members may reply to the email with
issues, questions, or objections. +
. The TSC chair and CTO jointly make a final decision as to whether to
approve a presentation. +
. If the CTO or the TSC chair are the sponsor for the guest, the TSC
vice chair will participate with the other non-sponsor (CTO or TSC
chair) to make the final decision as to whether to approve a
presentation. +
. If there are no objections and the questions and issues are resolved,
the guest will have an up to 30 minute slot at the meeting following the
2 week review period. +
. Guests who present may only attend the CCM for the duration of their
presentation. +
. Guests may bring one extra person to help make the presentation. +
. CCM will allow 2 guests/presentations maximum per meeting +
. The sponsor can work with the CTO & TSC Chair if more than 30 minutes
is needed. +
. The CCM may ask questions of the guest during the meeting and conduct
a dialog, but this is intended as a technical discussion regarding the
merits of the topic/proposal and not a strategic discussion about RISC-V
strategy, vision, or priorities. +
. Any discussions amongst the CCM resulting from the presentation must
occur after the guest has left the meeting. This privilege is reserved
for Premier members, Premier TSC members, and committee chairs. Allowing
others in those conversations dilutes the value of membership levels.
Guests are not permitted to join the general CCM for the same reasons. +
. If any regular member of the CCM is not able to attend a meeting, they
may designate a stand-in. That substitute cannot vote, but can attend
the meeting and participate in discussions.

=== Exception handling
For any escalations about guests being turned down (either by the
sponsor or by the CCM), please contact the CTO. +
The TSC chair and CTO may jointly ask a guest to join a non-presentation
conversation if they feel the member is needed to conduct the
conversation. Guests may not request this.
