==== Rationale

We use version numbers for RISC-V items like specifications, standards,
and software. Itâ€™s crucial for everyone, both inside and outside of the
RISC-V community, to understand these version numbers.

==== Policy

===== Versioning Standard

* We follow "semantic versioning" 2.0.0. Details can be found at
https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[SemVer]. +
* The first official version of any item is 1.0.0.

===== Version Structure

We follow the X.Y.Z-STATUS:

* X (Major version): incompatible changes or major new features. +
* Y (Minor version): fixes, compatible extensions w/ limited new
functionality. +
* Z (Patch version): minor corrections and editorial adjustments.

STATUS:

* Development (dev): early versions with active changes, like 1.0.0-dev,
1.0.1-dev, etc. +
* Frozen (frz): versions deemed feature-complete, like 1.0.0-frz,
1.0.1-frz, etc. +
* Main/master (ratified): The final approved version without a suffix,
such as 1.0.0.

Additional Information:

* If need be, non-final versions can include a build date as metadata
like +[build-date]. +
* Once a ratified version is complete, any new changes begin with a new
development version and the cycle restarts. For instance, if the last
ratified version is 1.2.3, the next cycle will start with 2.0.0-dev.
