=== Rationale


Create a clear and definitive set of guidelines for how and when you can and cannot discuss or reference encumbered information. Policy:

. Encumbered information can have a wide set of definitions and
instances. This policy may apply to situations where it appears that a
good faith mistake may have been made around the sensitivity or
licensing status of materials present in a RISC-V hosted location. If
you have a question about whether something is encumbered, please send
an email to help@riscv.org to set up a meeting to discuss the specifics.
If you are unsure, consider the information encumbered until you know
otherwise. +
. The word "venue" used below refers to RISC-V emails, meetings,
RISC-V GitHub or shared drive files, riscv.org website or wiki pages,
etc.that include RISC-V staff, meetings, files. +
. Never discuss or use encumbered information in any RISC-V venue unless
it is clearly identifiable as greater than 20 years old (e.g.Â published
paper with a date published). All later parts of this document refer to
encumbered information as items being less than 20 years old. +
. Never derive or copy or refer to encumbered information. If someone
adds something to a specification that you know is encumbered, please
alert the governing committee to determine if the specification refers
to or copies encumbered information. If it does then have it removed
from the specification. +
. You may compare your results to results the originators or their
partners or customers get from an encumbered implementation to a RISC-V
implementation. +
. Please pay attention to the fact that even though an open source
implementation may exist for an item, the documents or ideas may still
be encumbered. Unless you can solely refer to the open source code,
please treat it as encumbered information. +
. The Horizontal or ISA Committee should provide best-effort review of
specifications for the use of or reference to encumbered information and
remove it before Freeze and Vote-Ready milestones (see the
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nQ5uFb39KA6gvUi5SReWfIQSiRN7hp6z7ZPfctE4mKk/edit?usp=sharing[extension
lifecycle]). +
. The RISC-V Technical Program Managers will provide final review for
encumbered information as a sign-off step to the Freeze and Vote-Ready
Milestones (requirement for public review). +
. If you want to discuss encumbered information, you should do this
outside any RISC-V venue. +
. You must also abide by the
https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RISC-V-International-Regulations-03-11-2020.pdf[RISC-V
regulations and rules] (found on the riscv.org website). If anything in
this policy is contradictory to that information, the riscv.org rules
and regulations override anything in this policy. +
. If you have any questions please send a request for a meeting
regarding this policy to help@riscv.org.

=== Transition to start using policy +
This will be the acting policy until approved (possibly with
modifications before approval).

=== Exceptions +
None allowed.
