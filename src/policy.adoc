=== Rationale

We need to create and adopt policies to govern ourselves below the
bylaws.

=== Policy

. Use the policy template to propose a policy. All fields should be
filled in. +
. Proposer should do a preliminary review with a small group of people
before sending it broadly. +
. Send the policy out to TSC & Chairs with a two week timeout. Reviewers
may request a 2 week extension. Reviews must include a recommendation. +
. Recommendations can be (approved, declined, request more info). +
. Identify at least two specific people from TSC to review the policy
before it is approved. +
. Have the TSC chair review the proposal. +
. If approved, use the transition plan to roll it out. Communicate to
all task/sig groups. +
. CTO has final call +
. Policies that donâ€™t affect TSC get final approval by TG Chairs at the
weekly meeting. Policies that affect things like voting must go through
the TSC for final approval vote.

=== Exception handling +
If you want to have an exception to the rules to create a policy
escalate to TSC. If you have an exception for a specific policy follow
its exception handling.
